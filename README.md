# 👋 Hi, I'm ZeroX

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm am ** Senior Blockchain Developer** passionate about decentralized technologies and cryptography. My focus areas include **re-staking protocols**, **Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**, **Solidity Smart Contract development**, and **Golang** for backend systems in the blockchain ecosystem. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, building decentralized applications (dApps), and working on scaling and privacy-preserving technologies.

## 🔧 Technical Skills

### 🛠 Blockchain Development
- **Re-staking Protocols**: Worked on enhancing security and functionality of blockchain protocols by building and optimizing re-staking mechanisms.
- **Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Hands-on experience with ZK circuits, utilizing cryptography to ensure privacy in decentralized applications.
- **Smart Contract Development (Solidity)**: Developed and deployed multiple Ethereum-based smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains, with a focus on DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 solutions.
  
### 🌐 Backend Development
- **Golang**: Proficient in building high-performance, scalable, and secure blockchain backends using Golang. Implemented multiple services for real-time dApp data processing and blockchain interactions.
- **RESTful APIs**: Built and integrated secure, efficient APIs to interact with blockchain networks.

### 📚 Other Technologies
- **Ethereum**, **Polygon**, and **EVM-compatible chains**
- **Layer 2 scaling solutions** like Optimism, Arbitrum
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** protocols
- **Test automation and continuous integration** using Hardhat, Truffle, and GitHub Actions


## 🛠 Toolchain
- **Languages**: Solidity, Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Hardhat, Truffle, OpenZeppelin
- **Libraries**: ZK-SNARK, Circom, Golang’s cryptography package
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Other Tools**: Git, Docker, Kubernetes




## 💻 Open to Collaborations
I'm always open to discussing exciting blockchain projects, particularly those focused on scaling solutions, privacy, and decentralized finance.
